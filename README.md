### Evaluation

#### best_matching

Efficient implementation of the "best matching F1" evaluation metric for
clusters.

*Arguments*
* **truth** *iterable*: the truth clusters.
* **predicted** *iterable*: the predicted clusters.

### Graph

#### floatsam_sparsification

Function using an iterative algorithm to try and find the best weight
threshold to apply to trim the given graph's edges while keeping the
underlying community structures.

It works by iteratively increasing the threshold and stopping as soon as
a significant connected component starts to drift away from the principal
one.

This is basically a very naive gradient descent with a very naive cost
function but it works decently for typical cases.

*Arguments*
* **graph** *nx.Graph*: Graph to sparsify.
* **starting_treshold** *?float* [`0.0`]: Starting similarity threshold.
* **learning_rate** *?float* [`0.05`]: How much to increase the threshold
at each step of the algorithm.
* **max_drifter_size** *?int*: Max size of component to detach itself
from the principal one before stopping the algorithm. If not
provided it will default to the logarithm of the graph's total
number of nodes.
* **weight** *?str* [`weight wrt networkx conventions`]: Name of the weight attribute.
* **remove_edges** *?bool* [`False`]: Whether to remove edges from the graph
having a weight less than found threshold or not. Note that if
`True`, this will mutate the given graph.

#### monopartite_projection

Function computing a monopartite projection of the given bipartite graph.
This projection can be basic and create a weighted edge each time two nodes
in target partition share a common neighbor. Or it can be weighted and
filtered using a similarity metric such as Jaccard or cosine similarity,
for instance.

*Arguments*
* **bipartite** *nx.Graph*: Target bipartite graph.
* **project** *str*: Name of the partition to project.
* **part** *?str* [`bipartite`]: Name of the node attribute on which the
graph partition is built e.g. "color" or "type" etc.
* **weight** *?str* [`weight`]: Name of the weight edge attribute.
* **metric** *?str* [`None`]: Metric to use. If `None`, the basic projection
will be returned. Also accepts `jaccard`, `overlap`, `dice`,
`cosine` or `binary_cosine`.
* **threshold** *?float* [`None`]: Optional similarity threshold under which
edges won't be added to the monopartite projection.
* **use_topology** *?bool*: Whether to use the bipartite graph's
topology to attempt a subquadratic time projection. Intuitively,
this works by not computing similarities of all pairs of nodes but
only of pairs of nodes that share at least a common neighbor.
It generally works better than the quadratic approach but can
sometimes hurt your performance by losing time on graph traversals
when your graph is very dense.
* **bipartition_check** *?bool*: This function will start by checking
whether your graph is bipartite because it can get stuck in an
infinite loop if given graph is not truly bipartite. Be sure to
disable this kwarg if you know beforehand that your graph is
bipartite and for better performance.

### Keyers

#### omission_key

Function returning a string's omission key which is constructed thusly:
1. First we record the string's set of consonant in an order
   where most frequently mispelled consonants will be last.
2. Then we record the string's set of vowels in the order of
   first appearance.

This key is very useful when searching for mispelled strings because
if sorted using this key, similar strings will be next to each other.

*Arguments*
* **string** *str*: The string to encode.

#### skeleton_key

Function returning a string's skeleton key which is constructed thusly:
1. The first letter of the string
2. Unique consonants in order of appearance
3. Unique vowels in order of appearance

This key is very useful when searching for mispelled strings because
if sorted using this key, similar strings will be next to each other.

*Arguments*
* **string** *str*: The string to encode.
